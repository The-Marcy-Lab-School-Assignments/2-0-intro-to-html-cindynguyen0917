# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
As the name suggests, `semantic` elements clearly describe their purpose and the information that is contained, an example would be <header>. Whereas `non-semantic` elements don't give any type of information to the developer at a glance, for example <div>.
